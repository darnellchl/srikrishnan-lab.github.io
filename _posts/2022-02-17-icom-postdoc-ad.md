Our group at Cornell is [looking to hire a postdoctoral scholar](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/21204) to co-lead work on uncertainty characterization for an agent-based model of human-system responses to dynamic flood risk. The position is part of the Department of Energy-funded [Integrated Coastal Modeling (ICoM) project](https://icom.pnnl.gov/). 

The successful candidate will play an active role in shaping the specifics of the research and will have broad opportunities to collaborate with researchers from other universities and national laboratories. Expected qualifications include:
* A Ph.D. in a discipline relevant to uncertainty characterization and quantification for complex systems, such as operations research, statistics, applied mathematics, or environmental engineering; and
* Programming skills in at least one major scientific computing language, such as Python, Julia, R, or C++;
* An interest in applying quantitative methods to understanding the impacts of climate change on human systems.

Experience with coupled natural-human systems modeling and statistical techniques is preferred, though not required. The successful candidate will be expected to take on a leadership role in our group and help co-mentor undergraduates and graduate students. The position is available immediately, though the starting date can be flexible.
