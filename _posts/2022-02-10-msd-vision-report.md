The [MultiSector Dynamics](https://multisectordynamics.org/) (MSD) Scientific Steering Group and Facilitation Team has released its [2030 vision report](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5825890), co-authored by Vivek! MSD is an emerging transdisciplinary research field which seeks to advance our understanding of human-Earth system interactions and their impacts on our social, economic, and engineered systems. This Vision Report is a part of the development and organization of an MSD Community of Practice, and discusses key definitions and concepts as well. A key emphasis is highlighting scientific research opportunities and approaches and needs for improving the MSD community's research capacity.

There is also a webinar presenting the main themes of the report and seeking community input on February 22, 2022, from 1-3 PM ET. More information and registration are available [here](https://multisectordynamics.org/community-webinar/).
